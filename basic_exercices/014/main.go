// Exercise: User input
// Using only the fmt package, ask a user for it's name and then for it's surname
// Store it in 2 variables called "name" and "surname"
// After user has entered the data, print it out

// Tip: https://pkg.go.dev/fmt#hdr-Scanning

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Here goes your code
	var username, surname string
	fmt.Print("Enter your name: ")
	fmt.Scanln(&username)
	fmt.Print("Enter your surname: ")
	fmt.Scanln(&surname)
	fmt.Printf("Hello, %s %s!\n", username, surname)
